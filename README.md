Brandly UI Test
===============

The purpose of this test is to demonstrate the test taker's ability to improve
the look and feel of an existing "bare bones" web application by writing HTML
and CSS.

The functional component of the test is a single page web application built
with AngularJS.  The page represents a combined shopping cart and detail page
for ordering business cards and letterhead.  The detail component is a form for
entering the information to be displayed on the printed materials. There is a
placeholder block for a preview image of the items which would be updated as
the user types in form data.  This page would be an intermediate step of a
user's work-flow where the user has already selected a particular style of
business card and letterhead and is now adding and editing items in their cart
prior to checkout.

The main features of the application are:

* create a copy of an existing item in the cart with blank form data
* remove an item
* edit an item
* change the quantity/price of an item
* update of line item title while typing employee name
* alternative compact view for line items with > 5 items in the cart

Not implemented:

* review cart button
* real-time image preview


Instructions:
-------------

1. Open the application in a browser by navigating to `index.html`.
2. Update the existing HTML markup, add/modify CSS classes and add the
   corresponding CSS files and definitions to generally improve the look and
   feel of the app.
3. Make notes of any UI improvements that require additional developer support.
4. When you are finished, re-compress the `brandly_test` directory and email it
   back to us with a brief description of your changes and what you would do if
   you had more time.

The test should take approximately 1-3 hours to complete.  **Your solution
should be cross-browser compatible for most modern browsers (IE9+) and respond
appropriately to smaller view ports, such as tablets and phones.**  It does not
need to be perfect, but should represent an iterative improvement.
